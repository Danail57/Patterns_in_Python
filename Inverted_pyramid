This program prints an inverted pyramid pattern of stars based on the number of rows entered by the user.

How it works:
-`rows` is the number of lines in the pyramid.
- The outer loop counts downwards from `rows` to 1, representing each line.

For each line:
- Print spaces to align the stars properly, increasing as we go down.
- Print stars in odd numbers, decreasing with each line.
- The result is an inverted pyramid made of stars.

rows = int(input("Enter the row size for the pattern: "))
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):  # Outer loop for rows in reverse
    for j in range(rows - i):  # Inner loop for spaces
        print(" ", end=" ")
    for k in range(1, 2 * i):  # Inner loop for stars
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
